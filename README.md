# Elemental

Elemental is a UI framework. Yes, another framework. Its initial intention is for bringing consistent styles and interaction patterns to Acquia properties. It is built in a modular fashion so it could possibly be used for many other things.

## Getting started

You will need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) installed to build the project. Once those are up and running, you should also install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [Bower](http://bower.io), and [Bundler](http://bundler.io).

```bash
npm install -g gulp bower
gem install bundler
```

Now that the prerequisites are installed, you can install the dependencies and build the project. The easiest way to do this is to use the quick-start.sh in the root of the project.

```bash
quick-start.sh
```

This is simply a shortcut to install all of the Node, Bower, and Ruby package dependencies and then perform the default Gulp tasks. You can also just run the commands listed in that file manually if you wish.

```bash
npm install
bower install
bundle install
gulp
```

## Development

Elemental is a modular system and this repository is an assembly of core features and documentation. To that end, this is still a project that requires some development and also to serve as an example to derivative projects. There have been Gulp tasks created to help with that process.

### Build styles and scripts

Styles are generated using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer). The styles task will process the scss files and then add the appropriate vendor prefixes for the latest 2 versions of browsers.

The following 2 commands will generate the distribution styles. The prior is just an alias of the latter.

```bash
gulp styles
gulp styles:distribution
```

Since this is a modern UI framework, javascript is inevitable. So to generate all related scripts, run the following:

```bash
gulp scripts
```

If you wish to build all files that are meant for distribution, run:

```bash
gulp distribution
```

Build processes can mask the origin of styles or scripts. CSS is being preprocessed and aggregated with sass, then post processed with Autoprefixer and several javascript files are being concatenated together. To make development easier, add the ```--sourcemap``` flag to any command.

```bash
gulp distribution --sourcemap
```

When activated, a browser that supports these maps will point you to the correct file and line.

### Generate documentation

The documentation is generated using [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), [Github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown), and [Swig templates](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig). To build the documentation, simply run the following command:

```bash
gulp documentation
```

### Activate a local server and watch for changes

When developing, it is beneficial to have a local server. To make things easier, there is [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io) integration. To activate the server and also watch for changes, run the following:

```bash
gulp develop
```

This will do an initial build to make sure all of the files are available. While running, it will build and refresh the page if any changes are made. You can even open the page in several different browsers and the plugin will attempt to mirror all actions.

If you would like to share the page with a mobile device or another person on a different computer, there is [Localtunnel](http://localtunnel.me) support behind the ```--tunnel``` flag.

```bash
gulp develop --tunnel
```

There will be a url given to you in your terminal window that you can type into a separate device, or send to another person. All changes and actions will then be mirrored to those devices also.

### Destroy the current build

Sometimes you will want to get a clean slate. To clear out everything generated by Gulp, run the following:

```bash
gulp clean
```

There is also a bevy of individual clean tasks to for precision deleting. Multiple for many groupings. The easiest way to see them all is to run:

```bash
gulp --tasks
```

This will give you a mapping of all tasks and aliases.

### Audit documentation accessibility

To audit the documentation for accessibility, simply run the following command:

```bash
gulp audit:accessibility:docs
```
# google-homepage
